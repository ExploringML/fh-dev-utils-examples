# Tailwind Typography Plugin

This example adds the `@tailwindcss/typography` plugin in `app.css`. This is the new way to include plugins in TailwindCSS v4. Once the plugin is enabled you can simply add the `prose` class to any element to add typography styles. Any child elements will inherit typography styles.
